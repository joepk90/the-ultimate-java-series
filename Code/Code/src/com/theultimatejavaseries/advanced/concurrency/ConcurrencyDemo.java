 * Runnable interface:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html

 * The Runnable interface represents a task to be run on a thread.

 * - Run

/**
 * Thread Scheduler
 * The Java Virtual Machine has a Thread Scheduler.
 * 
 * The job of this scheduler is to decide what threads to run for how long.
 * If there are more tasks than avaible threads, the schdeudler switches between
 * these tasks
 * giving each a slice of the CPU time.
 * 
 * This happens so fast it gives us the illusion that these tasks are being
 * executed in parrallel.
 * But thatâ€™s parrallelism at software level.
